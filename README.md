## Afkara's Config Files on [ðŸ’¤ LazyVim](https://github.com/LazyVim/LazyVim)

# Neovim

I really didn't change much besides the dashboard and theme.

this tbh is [js](https://www.javascript.com/) for me tbh but if you like dis ig you can use it asw

- Transparent [Tokyonight](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim) Theme
- Add [nvim-surround](https://github.com/kylechui/nvim-surround)
- Add some [Recipes](http://www.lazyvim.org/configuration/recipes) provided by LazyVim
- Cringe-ify the Dashboard uwu

# Terminal

I use [wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) as my daily driver since it's got all I really need and the lua configuration makes it quite nice to use with nvim but it's not a requirement (I think)
